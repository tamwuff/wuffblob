* fsck already respects -n, but neither upload nor download do. Fix that.
* replace fsck ad-hoc state machine runner with actual runner
* remove BoundedParallelism from ctx
* change everything over to wuffblob::util::blob_is_dir()
* can fsck do anything to detect "foo" as a file, plus "foo/bar" as a file?
* switch to consuming errors everywhere, not taking a reference
