The "mime.types" file comes straight from Apache:
https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types?view=markup

Any modifications should *not* be made in this file. The mime.types file should
always be kept exactly as it is in upstream Apache.

If there is something that it gets wrong, that change can be made in the
"mime_overrides.regex" file. That one, we maintain locally.
